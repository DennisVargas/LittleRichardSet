**VERSE 1:**
<pre>

Every night just about 4

Whose the one who turns my lights down low

When it night and time to go to sleep

Whose the one who calls my name so sweet
</pre>

**CHORUS:**

(bg) Is it, Peggy Sue?

No, no

(bg) Betty Loo

No, no, no

(bg) Maybellene

No, no, baby baby all the time
</pre>
\\
**VERSE 1:**
<pre>

There may be other girls for all I know

Who could thrill me from my head to my toes

But when I'm sad and things go wrong

Whose the one who loves me all night long
</pre>
\\

**VERSE 2:**

There may be other girls for all I know

Who could thrill me from my head to my toes

I wait every morning just to receive my baby's kiss
