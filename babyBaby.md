## Baby Baby by Larry Williams
##### *(bgvc = = background voice line)*
**Verse 1:**
<pre>
every night just about 4
whose the one who turns my lights down low
when it night and time to go to sleep
whose the one who calls my name so sweet
</pre>
**Chorus:**
<pre>
(bgvc) Is it, Peggy Sue?
No, No
(bgvc) Betty Loo
No, No, No
(bgvc) Maybellene
No, No, baby baby all the time
</pre>
