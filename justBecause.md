## Just Because by Lloyd Price

**VERSE1:**
<pre>
E                                  B
Just because you left and said goodbye,
                                 E
do you think that I will sit and cry?
E                               B
Even if my heart should tell me so,
                                E
darling, I would rather let you go. 
</pre>

**VERSE2:**
<pre>
E                                     B
Just because you think that you're so smart,
                                  E
going around and breaking lover's hearts.
E                                 B
Before I let this thing happen to me,
                                 E
darling, I would rather swim the sea. 
</pre>
**CHORUS:**
<pre>
E7         A
I know you think you're smart,
     G#                            B
just going around breaking lover's hearts. 
</pre>

**VERSE3:**
<pre>
E                                 B
Just because I want someone who's kind,
                                 E
with a heart as good and pure as mine.
E                             B
But maybe I am asking far too much,
                                    E
darling, please don't ever break my heart. 
</pre>
**CHORUS:**
<pre>
E7         A
I know you think you're smart,
     G#                            B     B7
just going around breaking lover's hearts. 
</pre>
**VERSE4:**
<pre>
E                                 B
Just because I want someone who's kind,
                                 E
with a heart as good and pure as mine.
E                             B
But maybe I am asking far too much,
                                    E
darling, please don't ever break my heart.(Fade.)
