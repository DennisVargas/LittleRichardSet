title: Sigh Cry Almost Die
---
C          C7
Sigh, cry, almost die
 
F            Cm         Gm
I can’t kiss you again, this is the end
C7                               F
You’ve had your fun and now it’s done
             Cm         Gm
I can’t love you again, this is the end
C7                               F
You’ve had your fun and now it’s done
 
Bb
Love is a waste on you, 
                            F7
You couldn’t keep it if you tried
          Bb
You go on being you, you like to see me sit and
C          C7
Sigh, cry, almost die
 
I can’t kiss you...
